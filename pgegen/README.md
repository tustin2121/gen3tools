# pgegen

Generates a .ini section for use in PGE or other applications which read pge.ini files. These files are substitutes for .sym files, which allow a program to know where in the ROM or where in RAM a given symbol is stored.

pgegen requires a template .ini file, so that it knows what to look for and what symbols you wish to pull out of the .elf file generated by the compilation process of a gen 3 rom. The following is an example of what said template can look like and what you can request.

```ini
[????]
; Items without symbols will be passed through unaltered
ROMName=Pokemon HackName (English)
; Use the scripting deliniators to look up symbols and perform basic arithmitic.
ItemData=${gItems}
AttackNames=${gMoveNames + 1}
TMData=${gTMHMMoves - 5}
; Use # before a symbol name to look up the size of the symbol
; (Not every symbol has a size.)
TotalTMsPlusHMs=${#gTMHMMoves / 2}
TotalTMs=50

```
